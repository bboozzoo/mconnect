# Travis build script. The script reexecs itself inside the container (setting
# IN_CONTAINER=1). The proceeds to install build dependencies and runs through
# the whole build process. Source tree is bind-mounted at /mnt and the container
# has its workdir set to /mnt
#
# NOTE: it is assumed that the script is run while at the top of source tree
# (i.e. $PWD is your checked out tree, this crucial for properly mounting the
# source code into the container).
